#Optional:

# Create a MoneyMarketAccount class which should inherit behavior from the Account class.
# A maximum of 6 transactions (deposits or withdrawals) are allowed per month on this account type
# The initial balance cannot be less than $10,000 - this will raise an ArgumentError
# Updated withdrawal logic:
# If a withdrawal causes the balance to go below $10,000, a fee of $100 is imposed and no more transactions are allowed until the balance is increased using a deposit transaction.
# Each transaction will be counted against the maximum number of transactions
# Updated deposit logic:
# Each transaction will be counted against the maximum number of transactions
# Exception to the above: A deposit performed to reach or exceed the minimum balance of $10,000 is not counted as part of the 6 transactions.
# #add_interest(rate): Calculate the interest on the balance and add the interest to the balance. Return the interest that was calculated and added to the balance (not the updated balance).
# Note** This is the same as the SavingsAccount interest.
#reset_transactions: Resets the number of transactions to zero
